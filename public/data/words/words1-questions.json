    "question": "In React, what is the purpose of the `useReducer` hook?",
    "correct_answer": "To manage complex state logic by using a reducer function.",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "To replace the `useState` hook entirely in functional components.",
      "To optimize performance by memoizing state updates.",
      "To handle side effects such as API calls or subscriptions."
    ],
    "explanation": "`useReducer` is a React hook used for managing state that involves complex logic, such as multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. It provides an alternative to `useState`, particularly in scenarios where state logic becomes difficult to manage. \n\nThe hook takes two arguments: a reducer function and an initial state. The reducer function determines how the state should change in response to actions dispatched by the component. \n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useReducer } from 'react';\n\nconst initialState = { count: 0 };\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'increment':\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'decrement':\n      return { count: state.count - 1 };\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Unknown action');\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Counter;\n```\n\nIn this example, `useReducer` is used to manage a counter with `increment` and `decrement` actions. It is particularly useful when there are multiple actions or complex logic, offering a more structured approach than using multiple `useState` calls."
