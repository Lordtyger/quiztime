What is the role of manifest file in cache manifest software storage feature?,"A cache manifest file contains the sources that are required by a web application e.g. HTML pages, images, CSS, JS etc. On the very first user visit to a HTML site with cache manifest feature, his web browser will read the HTML5 manifest file, download the resources given and store them locally. In the absence of a network connection, his web browser will shift to the local copies and hence web application will be available to him even without a network connection."

"```
Review the given cache manifest file. What does a single character (/) before ‘offlinepage.html’ refer to?
CACHE MANIFEST
FALLBACK:
/ /offlinepage.html NETWORK:
.....
```","The fallback section consists of a single line. i.e. / /offlinepage.html. The single character (/) before ‘offlinepage’ will match any URL pattern on your site. If the browser does not find the page in the appcache, the application will display the page /offlinepage.html."
"If you have a cache manifest file that has no section headers, how will the resources be treated?","All manifest files are divided into three parts: the “explicit” section, the “fallback” section, and the “online whitelist” section. Each section has a header, on its own line. If the manifest file doesn’t have any section headers, by default all the listed resources are in the “explicit” section, hence they will be downloaded and cached locally."
"If your browser has visited the web page (cache manifest enabled) before and recognizes the manifest file, will all the resources mentioned in the manifest be downloaded again?","If the manifest file has not changed, the downloading of resources will not occur."

Question,Answer
misc, misc
"Set a view port, what are the options?","<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""/>

initial-scale=1.0 fits the viewport to the dimensions of the device (device-width and device-height values), which is a good idea because the size of the viewport fits the dimensions of the device regardless of its orientation.

width=device-width size the viewport to always corresponds to the (fixed value) width of the device, and thus is distorted in landscape orientation because que right value should be “device-height” not “device-width” in landscape (and it’s worse on iPhone5 whose device-height value is 568px, compared to its 320px device-width).

Therefore, I would rather recommend to use initial-scale alone, not associated width=device-width. Because the combination of the two is problematic, and moreover I think than even only width=device-width is problematic."
