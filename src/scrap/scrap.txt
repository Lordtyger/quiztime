Using this format create questions for the following question:
    {
        "question": "What does arbitrary mean?",
        "correct_answer": "something is based on chance, whim, or personal preference, rather than reason or necessity.",
        "incorrect_answers": [
            "The `apply()` method is used to define new functions based on existing ones.",
            "The `apply()` method is used to bind a function to a specific object.",
            "The `apply()` method immediately invokes the function, passing the arguments as separate values."
        ],
        "explanation": "<p>The <strong>apply()</strong> method in JavaScript allows you to call a function with a specific <code>this</code> value and arguments passed as an array. This is useful when you want to pass arguments dynamically, without knowing how many arguments there are ahead of time.</p><pre><code>function sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nlet numbers = [5, 10];\nconsole.log(sum.apply(null, numbers));  // 15</code></pre>"
    },
